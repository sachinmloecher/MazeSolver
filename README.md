# MazeSolver
In MazeSolver.py you will find my implementation of a classic maze solver using backtracking/recursion. Running the file using the given maze array will open a turtle GUI and show each step of backtracking until the maze has been solved. If the endpoint of the maze is unreachable the program will return the message "Cannot solve Maze".
